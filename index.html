        <h1>Campus Safety App - Project Overview</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I have been employed as a student officer at the 
            <a href="https://www.lawrence.edu/offices/campus-services/campus-safety-services" target="_blank">
                Campus Safety Office
            </a> at Lawrence University for a year now. 
            Campus Safety's mission is to provide each student, faculty, and staff member with a safe and secure living, learning, and working environment.
            Every day, a variety of requests come in from students, faculty, and staff.
        </p>

        <h2>Recognizing the Problem</h2>
        
        <p>
            The problem we recognized was that requests were made via phone calls. Because phone conversations are unstructured, 
            they take more time and can lead to miscommunication regarding the request details. 
            Both the requester and the officer relied on their memory, and officers often wrote details down on paper to write up a report about the request later on. 
            Additionally, communicating updates was difficult. For example, if a student requested a ride to the ER and an officer accepted via phone call, 
            updating the student on the officer's arrival required looking up their phone number and manually sending a message or making another call.
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing these inefficiencies, my boss, the Campus Safety Director, gave me the opportunity to partner with the university to develop a mobile app for Campus Safety.
            This led to the creation of the <strong>Campus Safety App</strong>, which modernizes request handling through a structured, digital process.
        </p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            As a solution, I created a full stack mobile application. I made two versions of the app: a student version and an officer version. In the app, there are forms with designated fields for all types of requests, making them clear and structured. 
            The request history is automatically saved in the database, so officers no longer have to struggle with reports. 
        </p>

        <h2>What is a Full-Stack Application?</h2>
        <p>
            A full-stack app can be best understood with a restaurant analogy:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend - The Waiter and Menu:</strong> This is what users interact with. Just like a waiter takes an order and brings it to the kitchen, the frontend collects user input and sends it to the backend.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend - The Chef and Kitchen:</strong> This is where the logic happens. Just like a chef takes the order from the waiter and prepares the food, the backend processes requests, performs necessary calculations, and sends responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Database - The Storage and Ingredients:</strong> This stores all necessary information. Just like a restaurant kitchen has a pantry storing ingredients, a database holds all user data, request history, and other information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Full-Stack architecture</h2>
        <p>
            I chose <strong>React Native</strong> for my frontend because it allows one codebase to generate both iOS and Android apps, avoiding the need to learn Swift and Kotlin separately.
            My backend is built with <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, and my database is a <strong>MySQL database</strong>. I deployed my service on AWS.
        </p>


        <h2>Database Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The Campus Safety App's backend uses a Spring Boot JPA setup with a MySQL database. Here is the database schema:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Users Table</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>userID (UUID, Primary Key)</li>
                    <li>username, password, usertype</li>
                    <li>firstname, lastname, phone, studentID</li>
                    <li>verified, verificationCode, verificationCodeExpiry</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Requests Table</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>requestID (Integer, Primary Key)</li>
                    <li>requesterID (FK → users), receiverID (FK → users)</li>
                    <li>requestType, location, message</li>
                    <li>requestStatus (pending, accepted, completed, canceled)</li>
                    <li>reserved, reservationDue</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>ChatMessages Table</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>chatMessageID (Integer, Primary Key)</li>
                    <li>senderID (FK → users), receiverID (FK → users)</li>
                    <li>messageContent, messageTimestamp</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>RequestOptions Table</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>requestOptionID (Integer, Primary Key)</li>
                    <li>requestTitle (String)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>LocationOptions Table</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>locationOptionID (Integer, Primary Key)</li>
                    <li>locationName (String)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>OfficerDriverOptions Table</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>OfficerDriverOptionID (Integer, Primary Key)</li>
                    <li>firstname, lastname, type (officer/driver)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>RefreshToken Table</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>id (Integer, Primary Key)</li>
                    <li>token, expiryDate</li>
                    <li>userID (FK → users)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This schema supports the app’s core features, including authentication, request handling, messaging, and role-based access control.
        </p>

        <h2>Backend Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The backend of the Campus Safety App is built using Spring Boot and follows a structured REST API architecture. 
            It is designed for scalability and high availability, ensuring smooth operations for students and officers using the mobile app.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spring Boot Framework</strong> - Handles API requests and business logic.</li>
            <li><strong>JPA (Java Persistence API)</strong> - Used for efficient database operations.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL Database</strong> - Stores user information, requests, chat messages, and tokens.</li>
            <li><strong>Spring Security</strong> - Manages authentication and role-based access control.</li>
            <li><strong>JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication</strong> - Ensures secure user sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Service</strong> - Sends automated verification emails using JavaMailSender.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Hosting</strong> - The backend is deployed on AWS EC2, with load balancing and auto-scaling enabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security Implementation in Detail</h2>

        <h3>JWT Authentication</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses <strong>JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</strong> to authenticate users.</li>
            <li>Tokens are signed using <code>HMAC SHA-256</code> for security.</li>
            <li>Each user gets a 15-minute Access Token and a 3-month Refresh Token.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Flow:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>User logs in → Receives an Access Token.</li>
                <li>Access Token expires → Uses Refresh Token to get a new one.</li>
                <li>Refresh Token expires → User must log in again.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Refresh Tokens</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stored in the database (`RefreshToken` table) for better security.</li>
            <li>Can be used to re-authenticate users without needing a password.</li>
            <li>If the refresh token is expired, the user must re-login.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📧 Automated Email Verification</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When a user registers, a 6-digit verification code is generated.</li>
            <li>The code is valid for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>The system sends an email with the code using `JavaMailSender`.</li>
            <li>User enters the code → The account is activated.</li>
            <li>If the code expires, the user can request a new one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Secure API Endpoints</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Public endpoints: `/user/register`, `/user/login`, `/user/refreshToken`.</li>
            <li>All other API endpoints require JWT authentication.</li>
            <li>Spring Security automatically rejects unauthorized requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frontend Features</h2>
        <p>
            The Campus Safety App is built using React Native to support both iOS and Android devices with a single codebase. It consists of two versions: 
            a Student App and an Officer App, each designed with different functionalities.

            <li><strong>Google Maps SDK:</strong> Displays maps for location selection.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Places API:</strong> Enables autocomplete search for locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Geolocation API:</strong> Fetches current user location.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Directions API:</strong> Provides routes for ride requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why AWS?</h2>
        <p>
            AWS provides the scalability, security, and reliability required for an application that needs to handle real-time requests and dynamic workloads.
            This setup ensures that the system remains responsive even during peak request times, with automatic scaling and efficient load balancing.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
            The backend of the Campus Safety App is hosted on AWS using a robust, scalable architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system architecture follows this workflow:
            <ul>
                <li>The client (mobile app) communicates with an <strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</strong>, which distributes incoming traffic.</li>
                <li>The ALB checks its <strong>Target Group</strong> and routes requests to the available <strong>EC2 instances</strong>.</li>
                <li>The EC2 instances process requests and interact with an <strong>RDS instance</strong> that stores all request and user data in a MySQL database.</li>
                <li>An <strong>Auto Scaling Group (ASG)</strong> manages the EC2 instances, automatically launching or terminating them based on demand.</li>
                <li>When the ASG launches a new EC2 instance, it uses a <strong>Launch Template</strong> to configure the server properly.</li>
                <li>An <strong>EventBridge Rule</strong> detects when a new EC2 instance is created and triggers a <strong>Lambda function</strong> that adds the new instance to the ALB's Target Group.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            This project significantly improved efficiency for both students and Campus Safety officers. By providing a modern, real-time solution, it reduced response times and streamlined operations. 
            The experience of designing and implementing a full-stack system strengthened my skills in scalable architecture, security, and user-centric software development.
