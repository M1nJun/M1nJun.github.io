        <h1>Hi my name is Minjun Lee</h1>
        <p>
            I am a passionate software engineer and a senior at <strong>Lawrence University</strong>, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science. 
            I have a strong foundation in full-stack development, algorithms, and systems. I am fascinated by technology’s potential to address real-world problems. My ambition is to create software that fits naturally into people’s lives, supporting them while preserving what makes life fulfilling.
        </p>

        <h2>Academic & Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🎓 <strong>B.A. in Computer Science</strong> - Lawrence University, Class of 2025 (GPA: 3.8/4.0)</li>
            <li>🔬 <strong>Computer Science/Math Research</strong> - Led innovative research in the fields of math and computer science to develop an algorithm that produces new examples of mathematical objects known as stable surfaces. Utilized graph theory and combinatorics through C++ and Python, resulting in significant time improvements.</li>
            <li>🏆 <strong>HackHarvard 2023</strong> - Collaborated in a team of four to develop GymBro AI, a personalized AI coach for users, providing customized workout plans based on fitness goals, preferences, and health data. Designed and implemented an intuitive user interface using Ionic React, integrated Open API via LangChain over Flask in the backend, and collected wearable device data via the Terra API.</li>
            <li>📊 <strong>LU Datathon, 1st Place</strong> - Analyzed the environmental and economic impact of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Conducted web-scraping and data wrangling using R Studio to present well-clarified data visualizations during the competition.</li>
            <li>💻 <strong>Software Engineer Intern, Campus Safety LU</strong> - Developed a full-cycle mobile application for students, faculty, and officers that streamlines interactions regarding various requests. This application will be deployed and used by the entire school in the next academic term.</li>
            <li>📚 <strong>Computer Science Course Tutor</strong> - Facilitated students with concept reviews, assignment approaches, and exam preparation through one-on-one tutoring.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Campus Safety App - Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong>Campus Safety App</strong> was developed to enhance student life at Lawrence University by streamlining request management. 
            The existing system relied on phone calls, leading to inefficiencies and confusion. This mobile app modernizes the process with a structured, digital approach.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🚀 <strong>Two Mobile Apps (React Native)</strong>: One for students to submit requests, another for officers to manage them.</li>
            <li>🌎 <strong>Real-Time Location & Maps</strong>: Integrated with Google APIs for location tracking and address searches.</li>
            <li>🔐 <strong>Secure Authentication</strong>: Uses bcrypt password hashing and automated email verification.</li>
            <li>📊 <strong>Admin Dashboard</strong>: Web-based management system mirroring the database for easy monitoring.</li>
            <li>⚡ <strong>Scalable AWS Deployment</strong>: Backend runs on EC2, behind an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling.</li>
            <li>📂 <strong>MySQL Database (AWS RDS)</strong>: Centralized storage for requests, users, and logs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: React Native</li>
            <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Java Spring Boot</li>
            <li><strong>Database</strong>: MySQL (AWS RDS)</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Hosting</strong>: AWS EC2 + ALB + Auto Scaling</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: bcrypt password hashing, JWT authentication</li>
            <li><strong>Maps & Location</strong>: Google APIs (Geocoding, Maps, Places)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Impact</h2>
        <p>
            This project significantly improved efficiency for both students and Campus Safety officers. By providing a modern, real-time solution, it reduced response times and streamlined operations. 
            The experience of designing and implementing a full-stack system strengthened my skills in scalable architecture, security, and user-centric software development.
