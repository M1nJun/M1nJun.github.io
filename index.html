        <h1>About Me - Minjun Lee</h1>
        <p>
            I am a passionate software engineer and a senior at <strong>Lawrence University</strong>, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science. 
            With a strong foundation in full-stack development, algorithms, and distributed systems, I enjoy tackling real-world challenges through technology. 
            My career goal is to develop scalable, secure, and user-centric applications that seamlessly integrate into people's lives.
        </p>

        <h2>Academic & Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🎓 <strong>B.A. in Computer Science</strong> - Lawrence University, Class of 2025 (GPA: 3.8/4.0)</li>
            <li>🔬 <strong>Research in Math & Computer Science</strong> - Developed an algorithm generating new mathematical objects using C++ and Python.</li>
            <li>🏆 <strong>HackHarvard 2023</strong> - Created GymBro AI, an AI-powered fitness assistant integrating LangChain and Terra API.</li>
            <li>📊 <strong>LU Datathon Winner</strong> - Analyzed the Russo-Ukrainian War's economic impact using data science techniques.</li>
            <li>💻 <strong>Software Engineer Intern</strong> - Developed the Campus Safety App to streamline student and officer request management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Campus Safety App - Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong>Campus Safety App</strong> was developed to enhance student safety and streamline request management at <strong>Lawrence University</strong>. 
            The existing system relied on phone calls, leading to inefficiencies and confusion. This mobile app modernizes the process with a structured, digital approach.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>🚀 <strong>Two Mobile Apps (React Native)</strong>: One for students to submit requests, another for officers to manage them.</li>
            <li>🌎 <strong>Real-Time Location & Maps</strong>: Integrated with Google APIs for location tracking and address searches.</li>
            <li>🔐 <strong>Secure Authentication</strong>: Uses bcrypt password hashing and automated email verification.</li>
            <li>📊 <strong>Admin Dashboard</strong>: Web-based management system mirroring the database for easy monitoring.</li>
            <li>⚡ <strong>Scalable AWS Deployment</strong>: Backend runs on EC2, behind an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scaling.</li>
            <li>📂 <strong>MySQL Database (AWS RDS)</strong>: Centralized storage for requests, users, and logs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: React Native</li>
            <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Java Spring Boot</li>
            <li><strong>Database</strong>: MySQL (AWS RDS)</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Hosting</strong>: AWS EC2 + ALB + Auto Scaling</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: bcrypt password hashing, JWT authentication</li>
            <li><strong>Maps & Location</strong>: Google APIs (Geocoding, Maps, Places)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Impact</h2>
        <p>
            This project significantly improved efficiency for both students and Campus Safety officers. By providing a modern, real-time solution, it reduced response times and streamlined operations. 
            The experience of designing and implementing a full-stack system strengthened my skills in scalable architecture, security, and user-centric software development.
